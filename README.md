# Quantitative Data Analysis

This repository contains work completed as part of the Quantitative Data Analysis module.

The primary focus of this module was to apply statistical and quantitative methods to real-world data, with an individual project based on COVID-19 data.

## Project Overview
An individual quantitative analysis project examining COVID-19 data to identify trends, relationships, and statistical patterns.

## Data
- Type of data: COVID-19 cases and deaths
- Time period: Pandemic period (as provided in the dataset)
- Geographical scope: Country-level COVID data
- Data type: Secondary, publicly available data

## Software Used
- R
- Excel
- SQL

## Methods Applied
- Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualisation and trend analysis
- Hypothesis testing
  - Correlation analysis
  - Statistical tests
- Regression analysis
- Distribution analysis
  - Histogram
  - Q-Q plot
  - Correlogram
- Normality testing

## Outputs
- Written analytical report
- Data visualisations and statistical plots
- Interpretation of quantitative results

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Applied quantitative methods to real-world health data
- Improved statistical reasoning and interpretation
- Strengthened skills in data cleaning, analysis, and reporting
- Gained experience communicating data-driven insights

## Outcome
This work demonstrates my ability to analyse quantitative data, draw evidence-based conclusions, and communicate results clearly.
